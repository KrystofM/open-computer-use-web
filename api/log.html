<p style='color:#006400;background:#e8f5e9'>THOUGHT: The objective is: search for cats
On the screen, I see: 
- The mouse is in the middle of the screen.
- The date and time are in the top right corner.
- The home directory is open in the panel on the left. 
- Included in that are the root directory, file system, applications menu, home, trash, and workspace switcher.
- There is an icon of another file system on the middle of the desktop, and the icon matches the file system on the left side.
- All of these are represented with a cursor the mouse hovers nearby.
This means the objective is: not complete.

The next step is to use the mouse to click on the icon for the home directory listed under the Applications menu in order to open it. Once the root directory is located, the user can use the mouse to click on it, and it will reveal any storage devices in the system. These might have files related to cats on them. The icon in the middle with no associated mouse could lead to files as well, and the user should click on it with the mouse to try and access them.</p>

There are also several other icons and windows in the background, but they do not appear to be relevant to the objective.
