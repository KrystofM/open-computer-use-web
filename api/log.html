<p style='color:#006400;background:#e8f5e9'>THOUGHT: The objective is: search for cats
On the screen, I see: On the top-left of the screen, the Applications menu has several items, one of which is "Home" with a brown folder icon with a house symbol in it. Toward the center of the screen, there is a mouse pointer and below it a white mouse icon on a blue background. The menu bar at the bottom of the screen includes several icons, including one of the Earth, an image of a magnifying glass, a yellow folder icon, and an app that looks like a browser.
This means the objective is: not complete

The next step is to click the yellow folder icon in order to see what files are in the Home folder. This should take me to a view of files and folders, which are likely named. This might give me an idea of which file to click on that will have the best chance of leading me to some cats. I am not expecting to see any cats at this point.</p>

On the screen, I see: 
There is a single application panel at the top of the screen. The application panel contains icons for setting the volume, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and a battery. There is a timestamp, and an icon for the search with a label that says 'root'. 

There is a single sidebar with icons for the Trash and File System. The File System icon appears to have a square representing sheets of paper and another icon above representing a house with text that says 'Home'. 


Finally, there is the background of the screen, where a mouse's cursor is located, positioned between the 'Home' icon and a small illustration resembling a mouse, not the cursor. Beneath the illustration of a mouse, a dock with various features and quick links, such as Money, My Computer, and the Web. It is located below the image and above the dark border beyond the screen.

All of this is on the screen's background. It is not clear if the background is full of the search results or because a desktop background hasn't been loaded.

This means the objective is: not complete.

The next step is to click the root icon in order to search for cats.</p>
