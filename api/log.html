<p style='color:#006400;background:#e8f5e9'>THOUGHT: The objective is: Searching Google to find cats.

On the screen, I see: 
* The application is: Firefox
* A tab is open on Firefox with the title: Welcome to  Firefox — Mozilla Firefox 
* The url displayed at the top of the screen is: Welcome to Firefo
* A pop-up notification is showing in the middle of the window with a title that says: We love keeping you safe 
* Inside the notification pop-up there is an image of a man hugging the planet
* Under the image in the notification are the words: Our non-profit backed browser helps stop companies from secretly following you around the web.
* Under that, there are two choices under the notification: Import from previous browser & Save and continue
* The Save and continue  button is selected on the notification
* At the bottom of the Firefox window there is a bar with four icons on the left side 
* A chrome tab is open on the background of the screen with the title: Firefox Privacy Notice 
* A magnifying glass icon is in the bottom right corner of the screen 
* A globe icon with a satellite around it is to the right of the magnifying glass icon 
* A settings icon is to the right of the globe icon with satellite around it
* A disk icon is to the right of the settings icon 
* On the top right corner of the screen, the settings icons are the back arrow icon, forward arrow icon, update icon, options icon, zoom icon, minimize icon, and the close icon 

This means the objective is not yet complete.

The next step is: 
I suggest clicking on Save and continue in order to get to the next page that allows a user to type into a search bar. Clicking the blue button will take the user to a page where the user can search for “cats” using Google’s built-in search bar.</p>

<p style='color:#006400;background:#e8f5e9'>THOUGHT: The objective is: search for cats on Google
On the screen, I see: 
Mozilla Firefox browser with 'Welcome to Firefox,' the signed in profile, tabs for Firefox Privacy Notice, and settings in dropdown menu. The menu is still open with 'Welcome to Firefox' webpage loaded in the active tab. The webpage shows a cartoon of a person holding a flame, the title 'We love keeping you safe' with 'Our non-profit backed browser helps stop companies from secretly following you around the web.' The Firefox Privacy Notice webpage is still active in one of the Mozilla Firefox tabs. 'Searching' is typed in the search bar. These icons/images are all centered in a white rectangle with black text. Inside the browser window, there is a light blue-gray background with a gradient from lighter to darker in color towards the bottom, and a darker blue-gray, outer frame surrounding it. 
This means the objective is: not complete

The next step is to click 'Search or enter address' in order to click out of the displayed page and back into the browser address bar so the contents can be seen.</p>
